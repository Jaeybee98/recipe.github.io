        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the parboiled rice with hot water and set it aside to drain. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>In a blender, combine the fresh tomatoes, red bell peppers, half of the onion, and scotch bonnet peppers. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot. Fry the remaining chopped half of the onion until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Pour the blended tomato and pepper mixture into the pot. Add the seasoning cubes, curry powder, thyme, and salt. Stir well and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the water has reduced and the sauce is thick.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken stock into the sauce and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, stir in the parboiled rice. Make sure the liquid level is just enough to cover the rice.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil or a lid, and let it cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. Avoid opening the pot frequently to retain the steam.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        <p>
            For a smokier flavor, <em>some cooks</em> add a few bay leaves to the pot while the rice is cooking.
            You can also add some butter or margarine at the end for an extra-rich taste and aroma.
